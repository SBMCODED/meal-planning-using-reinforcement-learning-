Reinforcement learning in meal planning is an intriguing application of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make decisions about what to cook and eat based on feedback and rewards. Here's how it works:

Agent: In this context, the agent is the AI system responsible for making meal planning decisions. It's equipped with a set of actions it can take, such as choosing recipes, selecting ingredients, and scheduling meals.

Environment: The environment represents the meal planning scenario. It includes factors like the available ingredients, dietary restrictions, nutritional goals, and user preferences.
